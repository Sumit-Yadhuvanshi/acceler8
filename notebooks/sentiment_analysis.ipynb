I see it's available though, so I'm going to try it for my next story.\\n\\nI use these models with Cursor AI and am a huge fan. I find coding way more relaxing. Nonetheless, one can't simply be a BA and use it, I still need to be a senior developer IMO to harness it correctly.  \n",

Is nothing sacred!?! Remember when this was touted as the final update that will convince the AI sceptic crowd? I do, it's not hard, it was last week. The good news is that if everybody tells Reddit that the new ChatGPT sucks, then ChatGPT will tell everybody else in a few days. I think the main issue is the removal of other models that previously could be used for specific use cases.\\n\\nI haven't noticed any improvements so far tbh, it's pretty meh. I cant believe the Chief Hype Officer would overhype its product  \n",
